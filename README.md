# assistive-tech-project
-This project has been made for an NGO called 'Oorja' in Kerala, India.
-It has been created to test the logical abilities of any hearing impaired induvidual and hence lead that induvidual into a career in software coding.
-A total of 20 game ideas were discussed and the ppt has been attatched to the master branch.
-This maze game tests an induvidual's logical thinking by measuring the amount of time spent in unnecessary areas of the layout.
-However the player will not know that this is the testing criteria.
-The only instruction given to the player is to collect as many coins as possible avoiding coin-eating monsters on the way.
-The game has been created using GDevelop.
-Three levels have been created in increasing difficulty.

-to Run it, follow the instructions given below:
1) Download Gdevelop using https://gdevelop-app.com/download/
2) Save the .json file attatched in the main branch onto your computer
3) declare this JSON file inside your Gdevelop project since (for the moment) you can’t import a .JSON file as a resource directly inside Gdevelop.
4) Open your main Gdevelop project with any notepad, and wait.
5) Inside your project you will find a tree called “resources”
6) Here is listed all the asstes used inside the Gdevelop project.
7) Save your file and now open your project with Gdevelop.
8) In “game settings”, open the Resources panel and you will see your file declared here.
9) Import all assets that have been attatched to the main branch into GDevelop.

There you have it! Have fun!!
